[This](https://www.census.gov/data.html) dataset from the Census Bureau is interesting. 
The data can be used to find percentage of people aged 60+ living in Florida. Or it can be used to find the spanish-speaking population in San Diego.


The textbook [Introduction to Statistical Thought](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lavine/Book/book.pdf) by Michael Lavine at UMass.
I am intrigued by this textbook because I have a crippling gambling problem and an understanding in statistical thought could only benefit me.
